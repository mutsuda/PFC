\chapter{Overall objectives}
The main objectives of this thesis are:
- Implementing and configuring a machine learning algorithm able to categorize web content automatically inside FlowSight. \\
It will serve as an enchancement of a larger application called FlowSight that analizes subscriber generated internet traffic within the network of different telecom companies.
- Initial tests for determining which algorithms perform better\\
- Solve language problems (lid) for better accuracy\\
- Analyzing the results as well as the algorithm performance is also part of the project.\\
- 


\chapter{Covered objectives}
The enchancement provided by this thesis has been already used by the company, in some of their projects. 
The initial tests with rapidminer are already covered as well as the language detection algorithm. The language detection was not applied in the company project but has been already implemented
for future uses.
The speed performance of the algorithm has been tested in two different machines using different configurations.
