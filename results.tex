%For each of the websites the module had to classify, information about the volume of consumed data on each of the connections was also available. 
%Figure \ref{fig:{img/volume_stacked.png}} is the result of combining the classification results with that information, before applying the language classification.
%the other data,

As we saw in previous chapters, FlowSight was already able to graphically represent the amount of consumed data in time \ref{fig:{img/total_traffic_browsing.png}}. The objective of this thesis was to
give FlowSight the power to accurately and efficiently categorize the traffic depending on the content of the visited URL. As we can see in figures \ref{fig:{img/volume_stacked.png}} and 
\ref{fig:{img/volume_plain.png}} the objective was achieved.
