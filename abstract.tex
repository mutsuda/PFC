"In the information era where large amounts of content are being generated in a daily basis, autonomous 
processes of sorting and categorizing become of high interest. 
This project consists in the design and implementation of a web content classification application 
including well-known document classification algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes and Maximum Entropy and 
inspired by proven tools like Mallet or Rapidminer. Accuracy and scalability are the main goals of the project."
