In the information era where large amounts of content are being generated in a daily basis, autonomous 
processes of sorting and categorizing the internet traffic become of high interest. 
In line with this, this Master Thesis consists of designing and implementing a web content classification application 
which include well-known algorithms for document classification such as Na√Øve Bayes and Maximum Entropy and 
inspired by proven tools like Mallet or Rapidminer. The evaluation of these algorithms in terms of accuracy and scalability is also addressed in this Master Thesis.
