The quick growth in the telecommunication industry is letting millions of people use their mobile devices to connect to the internet and communicate in a different way. The post-PC era is here and the 
the amount of consumed data per second is increasing together with the information that users themselves generate simply by interacting with the network.
Although the classical mobile device usage (phone calls) is still growing linearly the modern way of using them has been growing exponentially since the year 2007\ref{fig:{img/ericsson_global.png}}.

The remainder of the document is organized as follows. In Chapter \ref{chap:flowsight}, I introduce the FlowSight platform describing its characteristics and functionalities, and explaining my
expected contribution to it. In Chapter \ref{chap:research} I analyze the client requirements and perform some initial tests with a subset of the data. In Chapter \ref{chap:implementation} I introduce
the concept of Maximum Entropy and focus in the implementation and performance evaluation of the algorithm. In Chapter \ref{chap:enhancements} I discuss ways of improving the quality and accuracy
in the categorization. The results comparing the previously described enhancements with the original data are discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:results}. Finally, I describe some conclusions and future 
work in Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions}.
