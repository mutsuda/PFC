The result of this Masther thesis is not a standalone application, but an enchancement of an already existing high performance and highly scalable application called FlowSight and developed by Zhilabs.
FlowSight captures and analyzes the traffic in a network and gives the final user the ability to see the data in many different ways. The higher level of interaction with FlowSight is performed through
a graphical user interface in a web browser. At a lower level, FlowSight is based on workflows, which are a series of configuration files that using the implemented modules are able to perform a task.
