After applying all sorts of refining to the classificaction there are still some sites that are not being classified correctly. A clear example is the url "youtube.com". Whereas it is supposed to be
a social network or entertainment website, the content and text in it is generated by the users themselves and just a small percentage of the content in the website talks about what it really is.
This causes the website to be classified differently depending on the "social trends" of whenever the content was crawled.
- Other languages support, detect language and apply different model depending on it
- Unsupervised learning for automatically creating categories
